<b>Title</b>
An unsupervised algorithm for online review comprehension: An assessment based on online product reviews

<b>Abstract</b>
As ecommerce has grown, so has the importance of
online reviews. However, reading these reviews can be time-consuming. Existing APIs such as twinword, sentiwordnet etc. have limitations in flexibility and are also unable to segregate ratings for specific product feature. We present an unsupervised learning method to automatically summarize the information in online product reviews and benchmark its performance to supervised learning models. The method can help consumers searching for new products identify what features are important in a new product, and also use these reviews to assign weights to these features.
